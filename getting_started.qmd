# Getting Started with R

## Introduction to the data

The `medicaldata` package is a collection of R datasets that are relevant to medical research. The package contains over 19 datasets, covering a wide range of medical topics, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health. The datasets in the medicaldata package are all in a standard format, which makes them easy to use with R.

## Using packages in R

How do we get access to all of these interesting datasets? The beauty of R lies in its simplicity and ease of access to a wealth of data and tools. Unlike traditional methods where you might have to navigate to a website, download files, and manually place them into specific directories, R simplifies this process immensely. One of the big advantages of R is that it provides the capability to access numerous tools and datasets directly from the command line using a single line of code.

### 

In R, think of packages like toolboxes. Each toolbox is created by different people, and each one contains tools that are designed for specific tasks. You have to bring the toolbox into your workspace when you want to work on a project, similar to installing an R package. But just as having the toolbox in your workspace doesn't automatically mean you're ready to use every tool in it, installing an R package doesn't make its functions immediately available. You need to 'open' the toolbox to use the tools inside. There might also be times when you only need one specific tool from the box, rather than the whole set.
